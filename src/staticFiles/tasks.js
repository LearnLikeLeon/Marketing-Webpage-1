              Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:\n
        
              - An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes).  \n
              - Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis. \n
              - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads. \n
              - Client-side routing with optimized prefetching. \n
              - Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library. \n
              - Development environment with Fast Refresh support. \n
              - API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions. \n
